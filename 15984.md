# NFS Share User Mountable  
To address the **NFS Share User Mountable** vulnerability identified by Nessus Plugin ID **15984**, you need to ensure that NFS shares are not user-mountable unless explicitly required. Allowing users to mount NFS shares can lead to unauthorized access and potential security risks. 

  

## Steps to Mitigate the Vulnerability 

  

### 1. **Review NFS Exports Configuration** 

   - Check the `/etc/exports` file to see the current NFS share configurations: 

     ```bash 

     cat /etc/exports 

     ``` 

  

### 2. **Restrict User Mounting** 

   - Ensure that the NFS shares are configured to prevent user mounting. Avoid using the `user` option in the exports file. Instead, specify only trusted hosts. For example: 

     ```plaintext 

     /path/to/share 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) 

     ``` 

  

### 3. **Use Secure Options** 

   - Consider using options like `no_root_squash` only when necessary, and prefer `ro` (read-only) access if write access is not required. 

  

### 4. **Restart NFS Service** 

   - After making changes to the `/etc/exports` file, restart the NFS service to apply the changes: 

     ```bash 

     sudo systemctl restart nfs-server 

     ``` 

  

### 5. **Verify Exports** 

   - Check the active exports to ensure they are configured correctly: 

     ```bash 

     showmount -e 

     ``` 

  

### 6. **Implement Firewall Rules** 

   - Use firewall rules to restrict access to the NFS service, allowing only trusted IP addresses. 

  

### 7. **Regular Security Audits** 

   - Conduct regular audits of your NFS configuration to ensure compliance with security policies. 

  

By following these steps, you can effectively mitigate the risks associated with the NFS Share User Mountable vulnerability.
