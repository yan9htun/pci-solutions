# NFS Shares World Readable
To address the **NFS Shares World Readable** vulnerability identified by Nessus Plugin ID **42256**, you need to ensure that your NFS shares are not accessible to all users, which can lead to unauthorized data exposure. 

 

## Steps to Mitigate the Vulnerability 

  

### 1. **Review NFS Exports Configuration** 

   - Check the current NFS share configurations in the `/etc/exports` file: 

     ```bash 

     cat /etc/exports 

     ``` 

  

### 2. **Restrict Access** 

   - Ensure that NFS shares are not exported with world-readable permissions. Modify the exports to restrict access to specific trusted hosts. For example: 

     ```plaintext 

     /path/to/share 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) 

     ``` 

   - Avoid using `*` or `0.0.0.0/0` which allows access from any host. 

  

### 3. **Set Proper Permissions** 

   - Ensure that the directory permissions on the NFS server are set correctly. Use the following command to set appropriate permissions: 

     ```bash 

     sudo chmod 750 /path/to/share 

     ``` 

   - This command allows read, write, and execute permissions for the owner and group, while denying access to others. 

  

### 4. **Restart NFS Service** 

   - After making changes to the `/etc/exports` file, restart the NFS service to apply the changes: 

     ```bash 

     sudo systemctl restart nfs-server 

     ``` 

  

### 5. **Verify Exports** 

   - Check the active exports to ensure they are configured correctly: 

     ```bash 

     showmount -e 

     ``` 

  

### 6. **Implement Firewall Rules** 

   - Use firewall rules to restrict access to the NFS service, allowing only trusted IP addresses. 

  

### 7. **Regular Security Audits** 

   - Conduct regular audits of your NFS configuration and permissions to ensure compliance with security policies. 

  

By following these steps, you can effectively mitigate the risks associated with the NFS Shares World Readable vulnerability.
