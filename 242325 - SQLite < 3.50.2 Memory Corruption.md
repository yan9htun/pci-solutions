To address the **SQLite Memory Corruption vulnerability** (Nessus Plugin ID **242325**) affecting versions prior to **3.50.2**, you have two options: manually download and update SQLite or remove SQLite from your RHEL system. Hereâ€™s how to proceed with both options: 

  

## Option 1: Manual Download and Update of SQLite 

  

### 1. **Download SQLite** 

   - Visit the official SQLite download page: [SQLite Download Page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html). 

   - Download the **Precompiled Binaries for Linux** (choose the appropriate version, 3.50.2 or later). 

  

### 2. **Extract the Downloaded Files** 

   - Extract the downloaded tarball (e.g., `sqlite-tools-linux-x86-*.tar.gz`): 

     ```bash 

     tar -xvf sqlite-tools-linux-x86-*.tar.gz 

     ``` 

  

### 3. **Backup Existing SQLite** 

   - Backup the current SQLite binary: 

     ```bash 

     sudo cp /usr/bin/sqlite3 /usr/bin/sqlite3.bak 

     ``` 

  

### 4. **Install the New Version** 

   - Move the new SQLite binary to the appropriate directory: 

     ```bash 

     sudo mv sqlite3 /usr/bin/ 

     ``` 

   - Ensure the new binary has the correct permissions: 

     ```bash 

     sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/sqlite3 

     ``` 

  

### 5. **Verify the Installation** 

   - Check the installed version to confirm the update was successful: 

     ```bash 

     sqlite3 --version 

     ``` 

  

### 6. **Clean Up** 

   - Optionally, remove the downloaded files and extracted directories to save space.

## Option 2: Remove SQLite from RHEL 

  

### 1. **Remove SQLite Package** 

   - If SQLite was installed using the package manager, you can remove it with: 

     ```bash 

     sudo yum remove sqlite 

     ``` 

   - For systems using `dnf`, use: 

     ```bash 

     sudo dnf remove sqlite 

     ``` 

  

### 2. **Verify Removal** 

   - Check if SQLite has been removed: 

     ```bash 

     sqlite3 --version 

     ``` 

   - You should see a message indicating that the command is not found. 

  

### 3. **Clean Up Residual Files** 

   - Optionally, you can clean up any residual configuration files or dependencies that are no longer needed: 

     ```bash 

     sudo yum autoremove 

     ``` 

   - or 

     ```bash 

     sudo dnf autoremove 

     ```

By following either of these options, you can effectively address the SQLite memory corruption vulnerability on your RHEL system. If you have any specific configurations or additional questions, feel free to ask!
