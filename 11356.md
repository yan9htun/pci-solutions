# NFS Exported Share Information Disclosure
To mitigate the **NFS Exported Share Information Disclosure** vulnerability (Nessus Plugin ID **11356**), follow these concise steps: 

  

1. **Review NFS Exports**: Check the `/etc/exports` file to see current shared directories. 

   ```bash 

   cat /etc/exports 

   ``` 

  

2. **Restrict Access**: Limit access to trusted hosts. For example: 

   ```plaintext 

   /path/to/share 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) 

   ``` 

  

3. **Use Secure Options**: Avoid `no_root_squash` unless necessary, and consider using `ro` for read-only access. 

  

4. **Restart NFS Service**: Apply changes by restarting the NFS service: 

   ```bash 

   sudo systemctl restart nfs-server 

   ``` 

  

5. **Verify Exports**: Check active exports to ensure correct configuration: 

   ```bash 

   showmount -e 

   ``` 

  

6. **Implement Firewall Rules**: Restrict NFS access using firewall settings. 

  

7. **Conduct Regular Audits**: Regularly review your NFS configuration and access logs. 

  

By following these steps, you can enhance the security of your NFS shares and mitigate the risk of information disclosure.
